# Figures

The Jupyter Notebooks found here can be used to conduct the main phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses for each figure of the paper. Note that some notebooks are contain the code for multiple related figures (both main and supplementary). The code for reproducing the transmission heterogeneity analyses (main figure 7) can be found in [here](https://github.com/blab/mpox-dynamics/tree/main/polytomy-analysis)

high resolution figures used in the manuscript can be found in [`pngs`](pngs/) or as a pdf within this `figures` folder
